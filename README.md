# CPE 357 Boot Camp

Welcome, this is an asynchronous boot camp targeted at Cal Poly CSC and CPE students entering CPE 357 in Spring 2021. The aim is to prepare students for instruction and labs in CPE 357. While CPE 357's pass rates are up and its mortality rates are down, students are still challenged by multiple simultaneous learning curves including the C language and Unix APIs.

## Learning objectives

My goal is to dump everything I still use, practice, and remember a few years after taking the course. This includes gaining familiarity with the following:

- Tools including Make and Git
- The C Preprocessor
- C compilers, and their flags and options
- C language concepts including strings and pointers
- GDB, Valgrind, and the Godbolt Compiler Explorer
- Researching with Google and Manual pages

## Modules

1. [Environment Setup](./mod1/README.md)
2. [Hello, World!](./mod2/README.md)
3. [The preprocessor](./mod3/README.md)

[Intermission](./intermission/README.md)

4. [The Memory Model](./mod4/README.md)
5. [Firearm safety (Pointers, GDB, Valgrind, and Godbolt)](./mod5/README.md)

[Conclusion: It's dangerous to go alone! Take this.](./conclusion/README.md)

## Methodology

### Schedule

This "boot camp" is designed to be completed in the week of Spring break leading up to the start of the spring quarter. One module can be completed per weekday.

### Further Reading

Learning how to search for relevant information is one of the most important skills that students should take away from CPE 357. Students are encouraged encouraged to do their own research using their preferred search engine. Links to Google searches are provided in place of references.

## How to succeed in CPE 357

- Prepare before taking 357:
  - Complete this or another introductory course
  - Read the C bible: K & R's The C programming language
- Engage in 357:
  - Learn the material:
    - From the professor and the text
    - From outside sources
  - Practice the material:
    - Through labs and assignments
    - Play around on the side to answer any curiosities
    - There are no shortcuts to understanding what you are doing. C is hard like that.
  - Collaborate:
    - It is absolutely necessary to work with others to understand the material.
    - The best way to learn is to teach.
    - Obviously, plagiarism is stupid and hurts yourself. If your intention is avoid putting effort into your education, frankly, you should go back to eating dirt.
    - You __MUST__ follow your professors' guidelines for working together or separately.
    - Communicating the concepts of the materials to others is vitally important for your own understanding. Arguably, teaching someone else a concept is the only way to prove you understand it.
- Continue learning after 357:
  - It took two more C classes after 357 for me to feel comfortable in the language.
  - 357 is a stepping stone to doing things with C. No one expects you to be awesome at something the first time.

## Disclaimer

- My grade in CPE 357 was a C. I became productive in C but did not end up grasping a lot of the important concepts. Maybe I'm not a great person to take advice from.
  - I didn't have anyone to warn me of tricky concepts ahead of time and it hurt my learning.
  - I didn't collaborate with other students.
  - I had a terrible teacher and you will undoubtedly have a better one.
- I've tried to write this material in the tone and attitude that I've appreciated from many professors that made their classes fun and engaging.
- Its likely this material will contain factual errors and mistakes. I hope everything I cover here will be covered in your class. You should also do your own research (as in the learning objective).
- This material is provided without warranty blah blah blah...
